# _Planet Age Calculator_

#### _Epicodus Week 5 Repeat Project_

#### By _**KhanSahab**_

## Description

_This website determines a person age in various planet years. The person needs to input his age in the World and it'll give his ages according to Mercury, venus, mars and Jupiter years. This website also returns remaining life of the user on each planet depending on the life expectancy user enters. Or returns how many years has he lived past his life expectancy if his age is more than the life expectancy_


## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone the project and go in the root directory and type 
* npm install _to install dependencies_
* npm run start _to build it and have the website displayed_
* npm run lint _to see there are no errors_
* npm test to run the tests and see all of the test pass.

## Known Bugs

None. Js file calculates every thing correctly. Tests can be seen and the test file can also be see how it is testing.

## Specs Input
| Spec | Input | result |
| :-------------  | :-----------------------------------------------------| :----------------------------------------|
| **build**  | User Input:"npm run start" | Output: "bundle.js and index.js are built inside dist dir" |
| **lint** | User Input: "npm run lint" | Output: "Shows it has zero erros. Shows identation warning"|
| **Test** | User Input: "npm test" | Output: "Six Tests are run and it shows all are passing"|
### **Test type 1 _Two tests testing this method_**  
##### Test Input to a method "yearsLeftPassed":        "yearsLeftPassed([10, 8, 6, 1], [30, 30, 30, 40]))"
##### Test Output: [[20, 22, 24, 39], ["left Mercury", "left Venus", "left Mars", "left Jupiter"]]
###### Explanation: Test output shows two arrays. First displays the difference between age and expected age on Mercury, Venus, Mars and Jupiters. Second Array displays the corresponding planets and whether year are left or the person has overlived his life on each planet.
### **Test type 2 _ Two tests passing parameters to class constructors and getting output from main method_**
##### Test Input to class constructors with age **less** than expectancy : "ageCalculator = new AgeCalculator(79, 90);"
##### Test Output from method ageCalculator.plAgesExpects(): ["329 45 left Mercury", "127 17 left Venus", "42 5 left Mars", "6 0 left Jupiter"]
###### Explanation: Output shows number of years, numbers of years left on each planet.

### **Test type 3 _ Two tests passing parameters to class constructors and getting output from main method_**
##### Test Input to class constructors with age **More** than expectancy : "ageCalculator = new AgeCalculator(90, 79);"
##### Test Output from method ageCalculator.plAgesExpects(): ["375 45 Overlived Mercury", "145 17 Overlived Venus", "47 5 Overlived Mars", "7 0 Overlived Jupiter"]
###### Explanation: Output shows number of years, numbers of years _**Overlived**_ and _not_ less on each planet.
# Test type 4 _Test written at the end of __tests__/planet.test.js for repeat submission. This final test was commited when the test was failing but the specs it needed to test were not yet coded. Finally the specs were coded and the test started passing. It just checks whether the newly written code is doubling the planet ages.
